# AFEOL Project – Support & Assistance Guide

The AFEOL Project is built around privacy, anonymity, cryptographic integrity,  
and a strict security-first philosophy. This guide explains how to request help,  
ask questions, and communicate securely with AFEOL maintainers.

---

## 1. General Principles

All support communication is:

- **Privacy-respecting** (no personal data needed)
- **Anonymous-friendly** (Tor strongly recommended)
- **Encrypted-capable** (PGP public key available)
- **Minimalistic** (only essential technical details)
- **Open-source aligned** (transparent, auditable, reproducible)

AFEOL maintainers **never** use:
- analytics, telemetry, tracking cookies  
- JavaScript forms  
- cloud identity providers  
- third-party ticketing systems  

---

## 2. When to Request Support

Use this guide when you need help with:

### ✔ Installation & Configuration  
- Linux server setup (Debian/Ubuntu/BSD)
- Tor-only or Tor-preferred environments
- Local hosting and isolated deployments

### ✔ Documentation Clarifications  
- Publicly released AFEOL specifications  
- General architecture, configuration, or behavior of public modules

### ✔ Feature Behavior Questions  
- “expected vs actual” behavior  
- workflow explanations  
- stability or compatibility questions

### ✔ Security-Sensitive or Privacy-Relevant Issues  
Use **encrypted email** for communication that includes:
- cryptographic concerns  
- metadata/privacy implications  
- system logs or PoC snippets  
- potential vulnerabilities

## 3. How to Contact AFEOL Maintainers

### 📩 Official Contact (Email)
**afeol@proton.me**

You may write from:
- anonymous ProtonMail account  
- any Tor-compatible mail service  
- Tails / Whonix / Tor Browser  

> **Note:** ProtonMail supports Tor access.  
> I2P is *not supported* for email delivery — do not attempt to send via I2P mail services.

---

## 4. PGP Encryption (Recommended)

Public PGP key (ASCII armored):  
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AfeolProject/AfeolProject/main/.well-known/pgp.asc`

Use PGP encryption for:
- vulnerability details  
- sensitive configuration snippets  
- logs containing environment info  
- privacy or metadata concerns  

Do **not** include:
- personal identity  
- IP addresses  
- geolocation  
- anything linking you to real-world identity  

---

## 5. Tor-Compatible Support

AFEOL strongly encourages the use of **Tor Browser** or privacy-preserving OS environments:

- Tor Browser  
- Tails OS  
- Whonix  
- Hardened Debian with Tor routing  

All public AFEOL resources are Tor-safe and do not require JavaScript.

### ⚠ I2P Notice
Although AFEOL philosophy supports darknet-friendly systems,  
**email support cannot be reached via I2P (technical limitation)**.  
Use **Tor** for communication that requires maintainers’ response.

---

## 6. Public vs Private Support

### 🔒 Private (Encrypted Email)
Use when communicating:
- potential vulnerabilities  
- cryptographic issues  
- network security behavior  
- metadata or privacy leaks  

### 🌐 Public (GitHub Issues)
Use for:
- bugs not related to security  
- feature requests  
- documentation improvements  
- clarification of public modules

Never publish:
- vulnerabilities  
- sensitive logs  
- configuration secrets  

---

## 7. What NOT to Send

For your safety, never include:

❌ personal data  
❌ real IP addresses  
❌ device identifiers  
❌ browser fingerprints  
❌ photos/screenshots revealing personal information  
❌ cloud drive links (Google Drive, OneDrive, Dropbox, etc.)

AFEOL maintainers will **never** request:
- identity documents  
- phone number  
- social accounts  
- real-world personal details  

---

## 8. Response Time

- Acknowledgment: **within 72 hours**  
- Non-security issues: **3–7 days**  
- Security-sensitive issues: **7–14 days**  
(Depends on severity and complexity.)

---

## 9. Philosophy of Support

By requesting support, you acknowledge:

- The project is defensive, security-oriented, and privacy-first  
- All communication should be minimal and encrypted when relevant  
- Maintain­ers may ask for additional *technical* clarification  
- Sensitive issues must remain private until officially resolved

Thank you for helping keep the AFEOL Project secure, private, and resilient.  
Your contributions improve safety for researchers, journalists, privacy advocates,  
and individuals worldwide who depend on anonymity and cryptographic integrity.
