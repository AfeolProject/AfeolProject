# SUPPORT.md  
AFEOL Project – Support & Assistance Guide

This document explains how users, contributors, and researchers can request help, report problems, and find guidance for using any part of the AFEOL ecosystem (Portal / Su6 / SecureGSM / ZX-AE / Docs / Other modules).

---

## 1. General Rules

- Support is **community-driven** and privacy-respecting.  
- No personal data is required or requested.  
- All communication must follow the principles of anonymity, security, and responsible disclosure.  
- Sensitive issues should always be reported privately.

---

## 2. When to Use Support

Use this support guide if you need help with:

- Installation problems (Linux, Android, servers, Tor/I2P setup)  
- Misconfiguration or unexpected behavior  
- Documentation questions  
- Feature clarifications  
- AFEOL standards compliance (coding, documentation, security)  
- General usage questions related to AFEOL tools or modules  

For **bugs** or **feature requests**, use GitHub Issue Templates instead.

---

## 3. Private Support (Recommended)

If you need private or anonymous communication:

📩 **afeol@proton.me**  
_(Tor/I2P anonymity is welcome but not required)_

Use private support for:

- Security-related questions  
- Unintentionally exposed data  
- Vulnerability discussions  
- Internal design questions  
- Anything you don’t wish to make public  

---

## 4. Public Support (GitHub)

Public channels are suitable for:

- General questions  
- Non-sensitive issues  
- Documentation feedback  
- Community discussions  

You may open:

- **Bug report:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`  
- **Feature request:** `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`  
- **Pull request:** `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`  

Always avoid posting logs or data that contain any sensitive or identifying information.

---

## 5. Community Recommendations

To keep support efficient and high-quality:

- Describe your problem clearly  
- Include minimal reproducible steps when possible  
- Mention your environment (Debian, Ubuntu, Android, Tor/I2P mode, etc.)  
- Stay respectful and constructive  
- Follow AFEOL Code of Conduct and Security Policy  

---

## 6. Scope of Support

Supported components include:

- **AFEOL Portal** (all modules)  
- **Su6 Authentication Framework**  
- **SecureGSM (Android)**  
- **ZX-AE Specification (v1.x)**  
- **AFEOL Docs & Standards**  
- **Linux server environments (Debian/Kali/Ubuntu)**  

Unsupported areas:
