# Security Policy

This document describes how to report security vulnerabilities for this repository
and how the AFEOL maintainer handles them.

## 1. Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, contact the maintainer **privately** and **do not open a public GitHub issue**.

### Preferred contact channels

- Email: **afeol@proton.me**
- PGP key (for encrypted reports): available in  
  `/.well-known/pgp.asc`
- PGP key ID: **0xF5C291C51ADBE07F**

Include if possible:
- a short description of the issue  
- proof-of-concept or reproduction steps  
- affected components or configuration  
- potential impact and severity in your opinion  

Please avoid:
- exploiting the vulnerability in production  
- modifying or accessing data that is not yours  
- DoS or stress testing against live systems  

## 2. Scope

### In scope
- Source code, scripts and configuration stored in this repository  
- Official AFEOL project modules referenced by this repository  
- Deployments clearly controlled by the AFEOL maintainer  

### Out of scope
- Third-party libraries or services  
- Hardware or OS-level vulnerabilities  
- Social engineering or phishing attempts  
- Issues unrelated to security (use GitHub Issues instead)  

If unsure, report privately — the issue will be triaged in good faith.

## 3. Vulnerability Handling Process

Valid reports follow a structured review and response process:

1. **Acknowledgement**  
   - Initial response within **7 days**.
2. **Triage & validation**  
   - Confirm issue, determine scope and severity.
3. **Fix development**  
   - Patch created and tested; discussion kept private.
4. **Release**  
   - Patch published, mitigation steps documented.
5. **Coordinated disclosure**  
   - Researcher is credited if they request it; anonymity respected.

### Target timelines (non-binding)

- Acknowledgement: ≤ 7 days  
- Technical assessment: ≤ 14 days  
- Fix & release: ≤ 90 days  

## 4. Responsible Disclosure

The AFEOL project supports responsible, coordinated disclosure.  
We commit to:

- respectful and confidential communication  
- no legal action against ethical researchers  
- reasonable timeframes for mitigation  
- transparent advisories once fixes are released  

## 5. Non-Security Issues

For non-security bugs, feature requests and general improvements, please use:

- **GitHub Issues** → public, transparent workflow  

Security contacts must remain dedicated **only** to vulnerability reporting.
